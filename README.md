# Logistic_Regrssion

This is a machine learning model that is used for classification tasks. 
In this project, I have implemented logistic regression algorithm using Python and Jupyter notebook on an Australian weather dataset.

# Installation
The code was written in Python 3.7 and requires the following libraries to run:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn

# You can install them using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sklearn
Data
The data used for training and testing the model is an Australian weather dataset, which can be found in the data folder. The dataset contains information about different features of the weather and the target is to predict if it will rain or not.

# Usage
This project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook, in order to run the project you need to have Jupyter notebook installed on your machine and open the logistic_regression_australian_weather_dataset.ipynb file. The notebook contains all the code and explanations step by step for data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, evaluation and conclusion.

# Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. The performance of the model can be further improved by adding more features, or by using more advanced machine learning algorithms.

# Conclusion
This project provides an implementation of the logistic regression algorithm using Jupyter notebook on an Australian weather dataset. The code and explanations in the notebook can serve as a guide for understanding logistic regression and its implementation on a real dataset.
